# Loan-Prediction
Prediction Model using Machine Learning
The idea was to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.
This Project is based on my learning from IBM Machine Learning using Python
